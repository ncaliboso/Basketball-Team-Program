This SQL project helps a fictional collegiate basketball coach keep track of their players individual game statistics, team statistics, practice logs, roster, and playbook. The Statistics View allows a coach to select a player from the pre-loaded drop down list and then enter their stats from the last game, which will be saved to the global data. This allows the coach to see how a player has performed over the course of the year. The Seasonal Statistics View will then take aggregate data into account and add it to the teamâ€™s overall percentages.The Practice View allows practice logs to be viewed by player. The Roster View allows the ability to add players to the roster, in turn updated the global variables and dropdown lists on all other Views. This View is password protected so only the coach has access, to protect against security breaches. The Playbook View utilizes the Select Case function to display the different playbook images and steps.
